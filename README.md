🏹 Mahabharat Personality Matcher using Machine Learning & NLP
📌 Project Overview

The Mahabharat Personality Matcher is an NLP-based Machine Learning project that analyzes a user’s personality traits from textual input and matches them with Mahabharat characters such as Arjuna, Krishna, Karna, Bhishma, and Duryodhana.

This project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning classification techniques to build a personality prediction system inspired by Indian mythology.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional personality tests are generic and lack cultural context.
This project aims to:

Analyze human personality using textual responses

Map personality traits to Mahabharat characters

Provide an interpretable and engaging personality prediction system

🧠 Solution Approach

The system follows a complete end-to-end NLP pipeline:

Text preprocessing

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Model training using Machine Learning classifiers

Personality prediction

Character matching based on learned traits

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains text descriptions and personality-related responses

Each text is labeled with a Mahabharat character

Data is processed and cleaned inside the notebook

Features:

Raw text input

Cleaned & tokenized text

TF-IDF feature vectors

Target:
